## General info
The main goal of the project is to transfer information to one digital place. Until now, all such data was kept in different ledgers, which made access difficult. The system will be nice, transparent and easy to use, and you can even store information about firefighters' awards in it. At the end, it will also notify you about the end of periodic tests, recertification of first aid courses or technical tests of cars.
